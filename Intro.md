# Intro

Despite quantum mechanics high acurracy in representing microscopic world, It is not at all clear what quantum mechanics is about. Quantum has a well defined, unique terminology yet obscure for itself i.e wave function, collapse of the wave function. We cant infer what the mathmatical formulations represent physically.  

This was pointed out by famous cat paradox by Schrödinger in the same paper (pp. 440–41 in Bacciagaluppi & Valentini 2009), noted that it may happen in radioactive decay that

> the emerging particle is described … as a spherical wave … that impinges continuously on a surrounding luminescent screen over its full expanse. The screen however does not show a more or less constant uniform surface glow, but rather lights up at _one_ instant at _one_ spot ….

And he observed that one can easily arrange, for example by including a cat in the system, “quite ridiculous cases” with

It is because of the “measurement problem”, of macroscopic superpositions, that found it difficult to regard the wave function as “representing reality”.

From the Schr¨odinger’s cat paradox we can conclude that it is not clear what is the role of the observer. Moreover, it is also obscure where to put the border between the microscopic world, in which superpositions can exist, and the macroscopic world, in which they cannot.  

From the above conclusions it can be said that either we modify Schr¨odinger’s equation or we add something to the wave function for the description of the state of the system. Bohmian mechanics is a theory that follows the latter.

In 1935 Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen defended this possibility in their famous EPR paper. They concluded with this observation:

> While we have thus shown that the wave function does not provide a complete description of the physical reality, we left open the question of whether or not such a description exists. We believe, however, that such a theory is possible.  

# Bohmian Mechanics

In Bohmian mechanics the wave function follows Schrödinger’s equation as in quantum mechanics, but does not give a complete representation of a quantum system. Its function is to govern the motion of the fundamental variables, the positions of the particles. The particles are described by their positions, and Bohmian mechanics prescribes how these change with time by the Guiding equation. In this sense, for Bohmian mechanics the particles are primitive, while the wave function is derivative.  

For Bohmian mechanics the state of a system of ![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw== "Click and drag to move") particles is described by its wave function ![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw== "Click and drag to move"), a complex function on the space of possible configurations ![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw== "Click and drag to move") of the system, together with its actual configuration ![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw== "Click and drag to move") defined by the actual positions ![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw== "Click and drag to move") of its particles.  

The theory is then defined by two evolution equations:

The universal existence and uniqueness for the Bohmian dynamics is a nontrivial matter.   

For an ![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw== "Click and drag to move")\-particle system these two equations are enough to define Bohmian mechanics.  

For a scalar wave function, describing particles without spin, the form of the guiding equation above is a little more complicated than necessary, since the complex conjugate of the wave function, which appears in the numerator and the denominator, cancels out. If one looks for an evolution equation for the configuration compatible with the space-time symmetries of Schrödinger’s equation, one almost immediately arrives at the guiding equation in this simpler form as the simplest possibility.  

However, the form above has two advantages: First, it makes sense for particles with spin—and, in fact, Bohmian mechanics without further ado accounts for all the apparently paradoxical quantum phenomena associated with spin. Secondly, and this is crucial to the fact that Bohmian mechanics is empirically equivalent to orthodox quantum theory, the right hand side of the guiding equation is J/ϱJ/ϱ, the ratio of the quantum probability current to the quantum probability density. This shows that it should require no imagination whatsoever to guess the guiding equation from Schrödinger’s equation, provided one is looking for one, since the classical formula for current is density times velocity. Moreover, it follows from the quantum continuity equation ∂ϱ/∂t+divJ=0, an immediate consequence of Schrödinger’s equation, that if at some time (say the initial time) the configuration Q of our system is random, with distribution given by ![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw== "Click and drag to move")​​​​​​​, this will always be true (provided the system does not interact with its environment). - linked to ALLDAT 2.5  

**with an underlying deterministic model in which quantum randomness arises from averaging over ignorance**.  

## Application

 **Bohmian mechanics provides us with just such a model:** For any quantum experiment we merely take as the relevant Bohmian system the combined system, including the system upon which the experiment is performed as well as all the measuring instruments and other devices used to perform the experiment. We then obtain the “hidden variables” model by regarding the initial configuration of this big system as random in the usual quantum mechanical way, with distribution given by ![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==)![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw== "Click and drag to move"). The guiding equation for the big system then transforms the initial configuration into the final configuration at the conclusion of the experiment. It then follows that this final configuration of the big system, including in particular the orientation of instrument pointers, will also be distributed in the quantum mechanical way. Thus our deterministic Bohmian model yields the usual quantum predictions for the results of the experiment.  

As the preceding paragraph suggests, and as we discuss in more detail later, Bohmian mechanics does not need any “measurement postulates” or _axioms_ governing the behavior of other “observables”. Any such axioms would be at best redundant and could be inconsistent.  

## Quantum Potential

Bohmian mechanics as presented here is a first-order theory, in which it is the velocity, the rate of change of position, that is fundamental. It is this quantity, given by the guiding equation, that the theory specifies directly and simply. The second-order (Newtonian) concepts of acceleration and force, work and energy do not play any fundamental role.  

In his 1952 hidden-variables paper, Bohm arrived at his theory by writing the wave function in the polar form ψ=Rψ=Rexp(iS/ℏ)(iS/ℏ), where SS and RR are real, with RR nonnegative, and rewriting Schrödinger’s equation in terms of these new variables to obtain a pair of coupled evolution equations: the continuity equation for ϱ=R2 and a modified Hamilton-Jacobi equation for SS. This differs from the usual classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation only by the appearance of an extra term, the   

_quantum potential_U=−∑k(ℏ2/2mk)(∂2kR/R),U=−∑k(ℏ2/2mk)(∂k2R/R),  

alongside the classical potential energy term. - ALLDAT 2.7

Bohm then used the modified Hamilton-Jacobi equation to define particle trajectories just as one does for the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation, that is, by identifying ∂kS∂kS with mkvkmkvk, i.e., by setting  

dQk/dt=∂kS/mk.

This is equivalent to the guiding equation for particles without spin.   

However, Bohm’s rewriting of Schrödinger’s equation in terms of variables that seem interpretable in classical terms is not without a cost. The most obvious is an increase in complexity: Schrödinger’s equation is rather simple, and it is linear, whereas the modified Hamilton-Jacobi equation is somewhat complicated, and highly nonlinear. Moreover the latter, since it involves RR, requires the continuity equation for its closure. The quantum potential itself is neither simple nor natural. Even to Bohm it seemed “rather strange and arbitrary” (Bohm 1980: 80).  

# Decoherence

## The Measurement Problem

Often, the measurement problem is expressed a little differently. Textbook quantum theory provides two rules for the evolution of the wave function of a quantum system: A deterministic dynamics given by Schrödinger’s equation when the system is not being “measured” or observed, and a random collapse of the wave function to an _eigenstate_ of the “measured observable” when it is. However, the objection continues, textbook quantum theory does not explain how to reconcile these two apparently incompatible rules.  

That this formulation of the measurement problem and the preceding one are more or less equivalent should be reasonably clear: If a wave function provides a complete description of the after-measurement situation, the outcome of the measurement must correspond to a wave function that describes the actual result, that is, a “collapsed” wave function. Hence the collapse rule. But it is difficult to take seriously the idea that different laws than those governing all other interactions should govern those interactions between system and apparatus that we happen to call measurements. Hence the apparent incompatibility of the two rules.  

The second formulation of the measurement problem, though basically equivalent to the first, raises an important question: Can Bohmian mechanics itself reconcile these two dynamical rules? How does Bohmian mechanics justify the use of the “collapsed” wave function instead of the original one?   

This question was answered by What would nowadays be called effects of decoherence, produced by interaction with the environment, make it very difficult for significant overlap to develop between the component of the after-measurement wave function corresponding to the actual result of the measurement and the other components of the after-measurement wave function. Be that as it may, Bohm (1952) gave one of the best descriptions of the mechanisms of decoherence, though he did not use the word itself.  

## The Collapse of the Wave Function

In the previous section we indicated that collapse of the wave function can be regarded in Bohmian mechanics as a pragmatic affair, that the collapse of the wave function is an _effective_ collapse. However, there is a sense in which the collapse of the wave function in Bohmian mechanics is more than a matter of convenience, a sense in which the collapse is actual and not merely effective. Indeed, if we focus on the appropriate notion of the wave function, not of the composite of system and apparatus—which strictly speaking remains a superposition if the composite is treated as closed during the measurement process—but of the system itself, we find that for Bohmian mechanics this wave function does in fact collapse, precisely as the quantum formalism says. The key element here is the notion of the _conditional wave function_ of a subsystem of a larger system, which we describe briefly in this section and that Dürr, Goldstein, & Zanghì 1992a: Section 5, discuss in some detail, together with the related notion of the effective wave function.

One of the defining equations of Bohmian mechanics is Schrödinger’s equation, governing the evolution of the wave function. Among the defining equations there is no additional evolution equation prescibing collapse of the wave function. Nonetheless the textbook collapse rule is a consequence of the Bohmian dynamics. To appreciate this one should first note that, since observation implies interaction, a system under observation cannot be a closed system but rather must be a subsystem of a larger closed system, which we may take to be the entire universe, or any smaller more or less closed system that contains the system to be observed, _the subsystem_. The configuration QQ of this larger system naturally splits into XX, the configuration of the subsystem, and YY, the configuration of the _environment_ of the subsystem.

Suppose the larger system has wave function Ψ=Ψ(q)=Ψ(x,y)Ψ=Ψ(q)=Ψ(x,y). According to Bohmian mechanics, the larger system is then completely described by ΨΨ, evolving according to Schrödinger’s equation, together with XX and YY. The question then arises—and it is a critical question—as to what should be meant by the wave function of the subsystem.

There is a rather obvious answer for this, a natural function of xx that suitably incorporates the objective structure at hand, namely the _conditional wave function_ψ(x)=Ψ(x,Y)ψ(x)=Ψ(x,Y)obtained by plugging the actual configuration of the environment into the wave function of the larger system. (This definition is appropriate only for scalar wave functions; for particles with spin the situation would be a little more complicated.) It then follows immediately that the configuration of the subsystem obeys the guiding equation with the conditional wave function on its right-hand side.

Moreover, taking into account the way that the conditional wave function depends upon time ttψt(x)=Ψt(x,Yt)ψt(x)=Ψt(x,Yt)via the time dependence of YY as well as that of ΨΨ, it is not difficult to see (Dürr, Goldstein, & Zanghì 1992a) the following two things about the evolution of the conditional wave: First, that it obeys Schrödinger’s equation for the subsystem when that system is suitably decoupled from its environment. Part of what is meant by this decoupling is that ΨΨ has a special form, what might be called an effective product form (similar to but more general than the superposition produced in an “ideal quantum measurement”), in which case the conditional wave function of the subsystem is also called its _effective wave function_. Second, using the quantum equilibrium hypothesis, that it randomly collapses according to the usual quantum mechanical rules under precisely those conditions on the interaction between the subsystem and its environment that define an ideal quantum measurement.

It is perhaps worth noting that orthodox quantum theory lacks the resources that make it possible to define the conditional wave function, namely, the actual configuration YY of the environment. Indeed, from an orthodox point of view what should be meant by the wave function of a subsystem
